# Guess Who
This project is a React-based character guessing game that challenges your deduction skills. Similar to games like Mastermind, it tasks you with guessing a hidden character by selecting the correct colors for various features. Built using React, it provides an interactive interface with features like character selection, a color palette, a guessing board, and a feedback system to help you make accurate guesses.
